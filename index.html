      <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I was born and raised in colorado. I moved to Bend, Oregon to work during my year off from school. While out here I heard about OSU Cascades. I am currently a freshmen studying Computer Science.</p>
      <h3>Past work:</h3>
      <h4>Brownian motion</h4>
        <p>Brownian motion is the random motion of a particle suspended in fluid. The random impacts atoms on the particle lead to a random chance for the particle to go in any given direction. My program uses Openframeworks to visually represent this motion acting on mutiple particles at once.</p>
