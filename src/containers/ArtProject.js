        As I went and looked for details about the Charley Harper and his work I was really
        surprised with how soulless the sale of his work felt. Because of this ludicrous drive to
        sell his art after he has passed I really struggled finding details about his art outside
        how much I could pay to get one of his works on a mug and that I should really add it to my
        cart. So I ended up going through and snagging pieces that had quotes from Charley Harper
        that I could include with the photo to give it more context and meaning outside of it just
        being a geometric representation of an animal in nature. Some background on Charley Harper:
        Charley Harper was an American Modernist Wildlife artist who was born in the town of
        Frenchton, West Virginia on the 4th of August 1922. His rural upbringing shaped the focus of
        his artwork throughout this professional career. He touted his style as minimal realism. He
        worked to capture the "essence" of what he was trying to convey with the fewest visible
        elements as possible. This style took the complexity of living organism such as birds and
        broke them down into their simplest forms, shapes.

                  "It's two falls out of three for the guy in the mahogany trunks. Stag beetles have
                  the rich finish of fine, old woodwork and the nightmarish mandibles of man-eating
                  monsters. They also have all the athletic grace of bulldozers, which is why they
                  spend a lot of time flat on their backs, treading air, totally helpless. Is this
                  wrestling match a fake? Not on your scissors hold! It's for the loving cup. And
                  where is she? Bet she got tired of waiting around and went stag."

                  And like all small creatures of the night, the harvest mouse knows well its
                  message: BE MINE. The owl-mouse affair has been going on for so long that it is a
                  classic example of the enforcement of nature's unrepealable law that some must die
                  in order that others may live. Is there a villain in the piece? Sure. The barn owl
                  is a killer, say we who constantly strive to build a better mousetrap."

                  that matters. Who has bugged you more lately: mastodons or mosquitoes? Ask the

                  This male, hastening to reply to an invitation—sent by scent—from a female,
                  encounters a largemouth bass. But the fish has problems, too. The river it calls
                  home is badly polluted and the boy, tiring of trapping insects, is going fishing."

                  "All aboard for the moonlight cruise and concert under the stars, where this pair
                  of piggybacking loonlings, only hours old, will bond to the ancestral songs of
                  their kind. Hoots and wails, tremolos and yodels—it's hard to get a Handel on
                  their Water Music, but it will make your spine tingle with its evocation of the
                  awesome mystery of the universe. It's lyrical and hysterical: Mozart and madness,
                  Beethoven and bebop. It's the Rite of Spring—with a dab of Debussy."

        Below is a recreation of Charley Harper's cardinal (the original is on the left while my
        recreation is on the right). I originally planned on creating a selection of birds to
        randomly populate the D3 canvas with every time the page loaded. Turns out I bit off more
        than I could chew and this took waaaaaaaaay longer than I thought it would. But it was fun
        getting my toes wet working with something that I want to get better using.

        To demystify what you are seeing below each part of the bird is an individual shape being
        drawn onto the canvas in order. Meaning that to make the legs look all nice they were
        created before the body of the bird so it can overlap and create the nice edge that you see.
        D3 drawing works almost like a printing press creating elements on top of another until you
        have the chart or image that you want.
