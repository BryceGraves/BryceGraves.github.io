        As I went and looked for details about the Charley Harper and his work I was really
        surprised with how soulless the sale of his work felt. Because of this ludicrous drive to
        sell his art after he has passed I really struggled finding details about his art outside
        how much I could pay to get one of his works on a mug and that I should really add it to my
        cart. So I ended up going through and snagging pieces that had quotes from Charley Harper
        that I could include with the photo to give it more context and meaning outside of it just
        being a geometric representation of an animal in nature. Some background on Charley Harper:
        Charley Harper was an American Modernist Wildlife artist who was born in the town of
        Frenchton, West Virginia on the 4th of August 1922. His rural upbringing shaped the focus of
        his artwork throughout this professional career.

        Below is a recreation of Charley Harper's cardinal (the original is on the left while my
        recreation is on the right). I originally planned on creating a selection of birds to
        randomly populate the D3 canvas with every time the page loaded. Turns out I bit off more
        than I could chew and this took waaaaaaaaay longer than I thought it would. But it was fun
        getting my toes wet working with something that I want to get better using.
        <Divider />
        To demystify what you are seeing below each part of the bird is an individual shape being
        drawn onto the canvas in order. Meaning that to make the legs look all nice they were
        created before the body of the bird so it can overlap and create the nice edge that you see.
        D3 drawing works almost like a printing press creating elements on top of another until you
        have the chart or image that you want.
